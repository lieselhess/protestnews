# Web Design for Protest News


## Planning phase (updated 3/18/2017):

* Bootstrap, responsive layout: http://getbootstrap.com/
* Tiled card design. See "protestdesigntemplate.png" in this directory. Other sites with tiled card designs for comparison: http://pinterest.com  https://www.uxpin.com/knowledge.html http://www.kelseydrake.com/ https://www.awwwards.com/blog/
* Each tile/card will link to one of the target web pages auto-sourced from the web scraper. The goal of the project is to source all content automatically by creating data scraping algorithms that target protest-related online content. For the purpose of this project, these articles will not be hand-curated. The main focus will be to craft server-side software that sources protest news specifically without further human intervention. 
* Each tile will (if possible) consist of an auto-cropped image sourced from the target article article (Robothumb?). Images will likely only be implemented very late into the project (unless someone volunteers to work on it -- please do).
* For future consideration: consider whether to implement infinite scroll


## ON CONTRIBUTION:

1. Use protestdesigntemplate.png to start coding a front-end with HTML, CSS, JS -- ideally using Bootstrap framework, but whatever you want is fine, as we have nothing at all right now.

2. Link targets can be left blank. Most targets will be automatically generated in the future, so there is no need to supply targets for anything at this stage of development.

3. Remember that as a collaborative, open-source project, your code may be ovewritten at some point in the future and that this is normal. You are still a contributor. If your code does ever end up being overwritten, you can always link back to the version that contained your code for portfolio purposes.

4. You are also always free to fork the repository containing your code if you decide you want to go in a different direction by yourself. This is a main benefit of open-source development.

5. If you have an idea for an alternative design (as opposed to whatâ€™s currently in protestdesigntemplate.png), please create your own and submit it. The more people involved in the project, the better.
