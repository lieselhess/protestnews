# Protest News

The goal of the protest news project is to leverage an all-female team to build an open source web application designed to help people learn about upcoming political protests in their area based on geolocation or user-supplied zip code data. The server side application will read in location parameters, scrape news articles and/or social media sources, and attempt to return content related to political rallies in the userâ€™s geographic region. 


## Built With

* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - Open source Python library used for data analysis
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - Used to develop and sync Python source files
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - The front end web framework used 
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Vector graphics editor used to create UI assets
